Namma Yatri Data Analysis & Dashboard:
This project is part of a Data Visualization & Analytics assignment and focuses on analyzing ride-hailing data from Namma Yatri to extract operational insights, identify business challenges, and recommend strategies for growth. The project uses Power BI for data modeling, visualization, and storytelling.

📁 Project Files:
nammayatri.xlsx – Raw dataset containing 5 related tables
Technical_Leadership_PPT.pptx – Detailed methodology, technical analysis, and recommendations
Management_Leadership_PPT.pptx – High-level strategic insights for business decision-making
Methodology_Report.docx – Step-by-step report with data prep, EDA, and insights
NammaYatri.pbix – Interactive Power BI dashboard

🧠 Objective:

1. To analyze ride demand, revenue distribution, cancellations, and payment preferences
2. To identify high-performing zones and underutilized opportunities
3. To recommend data-driven strategies for operational efficiency, customer retention, and revenue growth

🛠 Tools & Technologies:

1. Power BI Desktop
2. Excel (Dataset)
3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
4. Data Modeling & Visualization

📊 Key Steps:
1. Importing and cleaning data from multiple tables (Trips, Trip_Details, Assembly, Payment, Duration)
2. Creating relationships and building a star schema for analysis
3. Engineering calculated fields like Trip Hour & Time Period
4. Developing DAX measures for Trips, Revenue, Cancellations, Conversions
5. Building interactive dashboards with slicers, drill-throughs, and what-if analysis
6. Presenting results in two tailored presentations (Technical vs Management)

👥 Team Members:
1. Mayur Prakash Gaikwad
2. Siddhartha Srivastava
3. Kuruba Sindhuja

✅ Outcome:
1. Predictable Demand: Morning & Evening commute peaks clearly identified
2. Revenue Insights: ~37% revenue generated in evening hours; top zones include Bangalore South, Yeshwantpur, Hebbal
3. Cancellations Challenge: Nearly equal split between customer (~48%) and driver (~47%) cancellations → major revenue leakage
4. Digital Adoption: UPI & Cards dominate payments, but cash still significant in some areas

Strategic Recommendations:
1. Dynamic Fleet Allocation
2. Driver Loyalty Programs
3. Off-Peak Promotions
4. Digital Payment Incentives
